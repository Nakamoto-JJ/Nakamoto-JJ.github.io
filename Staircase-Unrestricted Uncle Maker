# Ethereum Timestamp Manipulation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains research data and analysis on timestamp manipulation attacks observed across three ETH 1.x-style blockchains. Our study identifies four mining pools conducting coordinated timestamp manipulation, potentially exploiting protocol vulnerabilities similar to the Staircase-unrestricted uncle maker (SUUM) attack strategy.

## Key Findings

### Data Collection
We have conducted real-data analysis using three mainstream ETH 1.x-style blockchains:
- **Ethereum 1.x** (block heights 15505647–15535776)
- **Ethereum Classic** (23232147–23242146)
- **Ethereum PoW** (22905613–22915612)

**Collection Details:**
- Ethereum 1.x has been deprecated since September 2022 due to the migration to Proof-of-Stake. We collected approximately 30,000 blocks from September 2022.
- For Ethereum Classic and Ethereum PoW, we collected data for 10,000 blocks in October 2025.
- **Total dataset:** Approximately 50,000 blocks.

### Identified Attackers
Our analysis reveals four mining pools conducting timestamp manipulation attacks:

| Blockchain | Mining Pool Address | Status |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Ethereum 1.x | `0x829bd8...` | Identified |
| Ethereum PoW | `0x9205c2...` | Identified |
| Ethereum Classic | `0x406177...` | Identified |
| Ethereum Classic | `0x35aa26...` | Identified |

## Technical Background
For details on the **Staircase-unrestricted uncle maker (SUUM) attack strategy**, refer to: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05328](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05328)

The observed timestamp manipulation exhibits patterns consistent with the SUUM attack methodology, suggesting potential exploitation of similar protocol vulnerabilities.
